<h4>Dwarfs</h4>Dwarfs come from the north where never ending blizzards haunt the lands and glowing lava runs through the rocks. They have their great leader Olaf Ironglow who supposedly rescued thousands of people from freezing to death after the big bang. Olaf was a skilled smith in before the world broke down and after his hometown was catapulted into the never ending blizzards he kept his forge running without sleep for several weeks to keep the survivors warm and help rebuilt some shelter. At least that is what the dwarfs will tell you when you meet them late at night in a bar. Or early in the morning.

Dwarfs are smaller than humans (who would have thought?) and have longer beards. They are proud of what they are and their work is respected even among elves.

A specialty of dwarfs are hammers. They discovered that the act of hammering something can actually produce a lot of energy. While other races use their intellect and willpower to gain control over the delta radiation dwarfs use their hammers. Most of their machines are powered by hammers working like pistons in a motor and they have come up with some crazy weapons you need to charge with hammer hits before you can shoot them.
