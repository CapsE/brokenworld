<h4>Elves</h4>The elves for one began studying the delta radiation and “magic” soon after the big bang and had not many problems surviving in this new world because of that. They avoided problems we “normal” people had to solve in years of technological advances by just using this strange power they didn’t fully understand. Dangerous if you ask me but after a few explosions here and there they turned out quite alright.

Elves look like skinny humans with pointy ears. Their moves always look effortless and graceful unless of course they try to do hard work in that case they look like children about to hurt themselves.

When it comes to character elves are, let’s face it cocky. They didn’t need to worry as much about survival as we did and had plenty of time to start enjoying live again. I hate to admit it but they are great artists and more intelligent than most regular humans, they are also swift and can be quite sneaky if they want to.
