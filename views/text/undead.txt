<h4>Undead</h4>The undead were created when the elves decided to become immortal. Did I mention they are cocky? One of their arch mages (leading scientists in delta radiation if you will) researched how he could prolong the lives of his people and keep them alive even if they would get heavily wounded. What he forgot to mention was that he and only he would gain control over everybody’s mind that was affected by the magical “enhancement” he created. What followed after this came out was an all out war. The elves wanted to erase the threat caused by an army ready to destroy everything to give their master more power and the undead wanted to erase the threat of getting controlled by anyone ever again. The war lasted a few years and even more elves got “infected” during the fights and turned into undead but after a while the sides agreed that total annihilation wasn’t going to solve any of their problems.

Undead mostly former elves but human undead are not unheard of. Where they took severe damage to their bodies they regenerated a strange mixture of crystal and flesh that has a different color for every undead. Usually they don’t have problems with rotting flesh or other disadvantages of being basically dead but those of them who are especially weak can turn into actual walking corpses.

Undead are mostly known for their willpower. They had to fight for their right to exist in this world possibly more than every other being and that left its traces on their character as a whole race. While they were once proud elves not much is left of the cockiness. I guess dying is quite the humbling experience.
