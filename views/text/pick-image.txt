When creating a character it's best to not think about numbers. Think of something you want to play. Think of a character from a book, movie or somebody you know and try to build your character around that idea.

I personally like to browse the internet for pictures and take my character from there. Google is an obvious choice for that but I found that pinterest returns even better results. Try entering the search term <b>Concept</b> to get cool paintings and scetches instead of shitty cliparts. For Broken World the terms <b>Shadowrun, Steampunk and Cyberpunk</b> might also be of use.
