<h3>Races</h3>So you see a lot has changed in the last 60 years but probably the biggest change is we have elves now. And dwarfs and even some beings you could describe as “undead”. These new races formed when regular humans began to believe they are better than the rest of us and focused more and more on specific skills. At first it was only minor changes in their appearance but after a few years you could see a definite distinction between races. Now that they are having children these differences are getting even bigger. Though the other races have been around for a long time they have only recently entered the save realms of Capitol City and its surroundings.
