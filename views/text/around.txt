<h3>Around the city</h3>A city need supplies to survive and those supplies come from the surrounding farms, factories and mines. Factories are mostly built on higher levels so that the smoke from the chimneys disturb as few as possible people. The farms are on the same level as capitol city itself they get a lot of light here and the rocks are covered in grass and small trees. On the lower levels where the sun usually won’t reach the rocks lie the mines. The ore sometimes gets molten and refined right there but often it’s brought straight up with cable cars to the higher levels where it gets refined.

A half a day journey to the south of capitol city lies the town “Worlds End” it marks the end of the jurisdiction of the marines and is a hub for criminals of all kinds.
