<h3>Capitol City (Hamburg 2070)</h3>So enough of this big talk about strange physics. What does that all mean for our current situation? Well most of us live in capitol city. It’s pretty much your average metropole but a bit smaller than you might be used to and placed on a giant flying rock. At the top of the rock are the skyscrapers of the big corporations like “Sebastian Steel” or “Biotech Inc.”. Even though this buildings contain the offices of companies they are also the homes of the rich and beautiful of capitol city.

A bit further down within the rock lies the big marketplace. You can buy anything here… well anything legal. Also people with solid regular income live here.

If you go even further you get to the docks a giant cave within the rock. While a bit dirtier then the upper regions of the city it’s still a place where you can find people of all kind that are arriving or leaving the city. The train station for the cable cars is also down here.

From here it doesn’t go much further down but on the same level directly connected with the harbor is the main base of the marines. This military area is where new recruits get trained and the commanders have their offices.

On the other side of the docs are the slums the district where all the people end up that don’t have anywhere else to stay. It’s mainly cheap built huts that were built daringly over the open abyss on the outside of the rock. Living here is dangerous mostly because there are no official building guidelines at place and people rely on the work of others that has been done with almost no quality materials. Most government officials don’t consider the slums a part of the city so that they don’t have to deal with all the problems there.
